  abstract  = {Collective adaptive systems (CASs) are challenging
from the engineering perspective. Different techniques aim at
taming these systems, either using declarative or black-box approaches (e.g. Machine Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, etc.).
Among the many declarative approaches, Aggregate Computing
is a novel technique by which developers can express collective
system behaviours from a global perspective, using a compositional and functional programming technique. Over the years,
Aggregate Computing has been applied in different scenarios,
ranging from smart cities to a crowd of augmented people.
Despite its promising capabilities, it is sometimes challenging to
describe aggregate behaviours, so we aim at merging Aggregate
Computing with black-box techniques to simplify the aggregate
program synthesis}
